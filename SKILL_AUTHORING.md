# SKILL_AUTHORING.md

A conformance standard for writing agent skills that run unmodified across
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf,
and OpenCode. The `SKILL.md` format is the shared substrate; this document
defines the portable subset and the gates a skill must pass before it ships.

Scope: authoring rules plus pass/fail gates. The gates are split into
**mechanical** (a script can verify) and **judgement** (a human or agent reads
and decides). A skill conforms when every mechanical gate passes and no
judgement gate is failing.

---

## 1. Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # required; YAML frontmatter + markdown body
├── reference.md      # optional; loaded on demand
├── examples.md       # optional; loaded on demand
└── scripts/          # optional; executed via bash, never read into context
    └── validate.py
```

Only `SKILL.md` is required. Everything else exists to keep `SKILL.md` short.

## 2. Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extracts text and tables from PDFs, fills forms, merges documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or extraction.
---
```

`name` and `description` are the only fields guaranteed to be read by every
agent. Anything else (Claude Code's `context`, Codex's `openai.yaml` keys,
`allowed-tools`) is tool-specific and breaks the portability guarantee. Keep it
out of a skill meant to be universal, or fence it so a missing parser degrades
cleanly.

The `description` is the entire discovery mechanism. It is the only text
pre-loaded into the agent's context, so it is the sole basis for deciding
whether the skill fires. Write it third person, as *what it does* plus *when to
use it*, and pack it with the nouns a user would actually type. A vague
description is the most common reason a correct skill never triggers.

## 3. Body

Procedural knowledge: workflows, decision points, gotchas. Three loading tiers
operate here — frontmatter is always resident, the `SKILL.md` body is read once
the skill triggers, and supporting files are read only when the body points to
them. Push depth outward:

```
## Editing documents
For tracked changes see REDLINING.md
For OOXML internals see OOXML.md
```

The linked file costs nothing until the task needs it. Scripts cost only their
output, not their source, because they run under bash rather than being read —
so deterministic logic belongs in a script, not in prose the agent has to
re-derive each time.

State rules with their reason. A naked imperative tells the agent the letter of
a rule but not how to handle the case the rule never anticipated.

```
Use constructor injection. Field injection can't be mocked without a Spring
context, so it breaks unit tests.
```

reads better and generalises further than `NEVER use field injection`. The
reason becomes the rubric for the edge cases.

For multi-step work, give an ordered checklist the agent copies into its
response and ticks off. Where output quality matters, add a validation loop:
run a check, fix what it flags, repeat until clean. The check can be a script
or a reference doc the agent compares against.

## 4. Portability constraints

- The hosted execution environment has no network and no runtime package
  installation. List required packages in the body and confirm they are present
  in the target environment. Stdlib-only scripts avoid the problem entirely and
  are the safest default for a skill distributed across agents.
- Reference every supporting file by relative path. Absolute paths and
  repo-specific layouts do not survive being copied into another agent's skills
  directory.
- When documenting file creation in the body, use a heredoc rather than a
  "create this file:" heading followed by a code block:

  ```
  cat > config/settings.yaml << 'EOF'
  key: value
  EOF
  ```

  The heredoc is unambiguous about target path and exact content; the heading
  form leaves the agent to infer both.

## 5. Conformance gates

Each gate has an ID, an assertion, the check, and the pass condition. Mechanical
gates are phrased so a linter can evaluate them. Run mechanical gates first;
they are cheap and catch the structural failures.

### Mechanical

**G1 — Frontmatter present and parseable.**
Check: file begins with a `---` fenced block that parses as YAML.
Pass: parse succeeds and yields a mapping.

**G2 — Required keys.**
Check: the mapping contains `name` and `description`, both non-empty strings.
Pass: both present and non-empty.

**G3 — Name format.**
Check: `name` is lowercase, hyphen-separated, ≤ 64 chars, and equals the
containing directory name.
Pass: matches `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, length ≤ 64, equals dirname.

**G4 — Description length.**
Check: `description` length ≤ 1024 chars.
Pass: within bound. (Empty or one-word descriptions also fail G9.)

**G5 — Portable frontmatter only.**
Check: frontmatter keys are a subset of `{name, description}` for a skill
declaring itself universal. Extra keys are reported, not silently accepted.
Pass: no keys outside the allowed set, OR each extra key is documented in a
`# Portability notes` section as a known tool-specific extension.

**G6 — Body length.**
Check: line count of the markdown body (everything after the closing `---`).
Pass: ≤ 500 lines. Over the limit means content belongs in a reference file.

**G7 — References resolve.**
Check: every relative path and intra-repo link in the body points to a file
that exists in the skill directory.
Pass: zero dangling references.

**G8 — Imperative density.**
Check: count of standalone all-caps directives (`MUST`, `ALWAYS`, `NEVER`) in
the body.
Pass: each occurrence is accompanied within the same paragraph by a reason. A
linter approximates this by flagging any such token whose sentence contains no
"because", "so", "since", or equivalent causal marker, for human review.

### Judgement

**G9 — Description triggers.**
Assertion: the description names the artifacts, file types, and verbs a user
would actually say, not an abstract category.
Fail signal: you cannot list three realistic user phrasings the description
would match.

**G10 — Reason over rule.**
Assertion: rules in the body explain why, so the agent can generalise.
Fail signal: imperatives that would leave the agent guessing on an unlisted
edge case.

**G11 — Disclosure discipline.**
Assertion: detail used in a minority of runs lives in a reference file, not the
body.
Fail signal: the body is near the G6 limit because of content most tasks skip.

**G12 — Logic in scripts.**
Assertion: deterministic, repeatable procedures are scripts the agent executes,
not prose it re-derives.
Fail signal: the body walks through a fixed algorithm step by step in English.

**G13 — Real invocation.**
Assertion: the skill has been triggered on at least one genuine task end to end,
not only read back.
Fail signal: no record of the skill firing and producing correct output.

**G14 — Cross-agent dry run.**
Assertion: the skill has been dropped into at least one second agent's skills
directory and triggered there.
Fail signal: only ever exercised in the agent it was written for.

## 6. Ship checklist

A skill ships when G1–G8 pass mechanically and G9–G14 have no open fail signal.
A future `lint-skill.sh` reads this file's mechanical section and asserts G1–G8
directly; the judgement gates stay a human or agent review step.
